## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.3.5
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (for background jobs)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gyansingh18/ai-tutor-learning-platform.git
   cd ai-tutor-learning-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp config/env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Set up database**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL
   brew services start postgresql@14

   # Create databases
   createdb ai_tutor_g_development
   createdb ai_tutor_g_test

   # Run migrations
   rails db:migrate

   # Seed the database
   rails db:seed
   ```

5. **Start Redis** (for background jobs)
   ```bash
   brew services start redis
   ```

6. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

7. **Start Sidekiq** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   bundle exec sidekiq
   ```

### Default Users

After running seeds, you'll have these default users:

- **Admin**: `admin@aitutor.com` / `password123`
- **Student**: `student@aitutor.com` / `password123`

## 📚 Usage

### For Students
1. Log in with student credentials
2. Select your Grade → Subject → Chapter
3. Access interactive learning tasks with three-panel interface:
   - **Left Panel**: Detailed concept explanations
   - **Middle Panel**: Input fields for answers
   - **Right Panel**: Results and feedback
4. Track your progress with the visual progress bar
5. Ask additional questions and get AI-powered answers
6. View your learning history

### For Admins
1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Upload PDF textbooks for specific chapters
3. Generate AI-powered learning tasks automatically
4. Monitor student activity and progress in the dashboard
5. Manage content and users

## 🔧 Configuration

### OpenAI API
- Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
- Add it to your `.env` file
- The app uses -gpt-4o-minifor answers and text-embedding-3-small for embeddings

### File Storage
- Development: Local storage
- Production: Configure S3 in `config/storage.yml`

### Database
- Development: PostgreSQL with PgVector
- Production: Configure your production database URL

## 🧠 How AI Task Generation Works

1. **Content Analysis**: AI analyzes chapter content from uploaded PDFs
2. **Task Creation**: Generates 6-10 comprehensive learning tasks including:
   - Detailed concept explanations (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Progressive difficulty levels
   - Multiple question types (MCQ, fill-in-blank, true/false, etc.)
   - Correct answers with explanations
3. **Task Storage**: Tasks are stored in the database with student progress tracking
4. **Interactive Learning**: Students complete tasks through the three-panel interface
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar shows completion percentage

## 🧠 How RAG Works

1. **PDF Upload**: Admin uploads textbook PDF
2. **Text Extraction**: PDF text is extracted and cleaned
3. **Chunking**: Text is split into manageable chunks
4. **Embedding**: Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings
5. **Storage**: Embeddings stored in PostgreSQL with PgVector
6. **Query**: Student asks question
7. **Similarity Search**: Question embedding compared to stored chunks
8. **Answer Generation**: Relevant chunks + question sent to GPT for answer
